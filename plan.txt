==========================================================

idea:
    - power generator goes out
    - need to fix generator
    - fix with parts from around the area
    - each part brings you closer to the goal of fixing the machine
    - machine will start up again with each part but will break down unless
      it's the last item

theme:
    - wacky, evil scientist/dr. frankenstein vibe
    - comedy - really strange

characters:
    - player, fritz/igor/ygor
	- his eyes are both vacant and disturbingly present. That is because he is cross-eyed and each is lost in the wide white sclera of alertness. The rest of his face is rather telling: a tense jaw, appeasing tiny smile, a crooked nose, bald brows, surrounded in fitted hood. The large hump in his back and how it forces his posture to hunch in compensation can explain the mix of long gangly limbs on a short, pudgy body. The final disturbing detail only becomes noticeable when he travels- a dead leg which must be dragged along with every step
